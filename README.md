BanQ is a mobile app designed for the SNU community to help students and other residents manage their expenses and personal finance. 

BanQ aims to establish itself as the go to app for the student community in order for them to effectively manage their monthly budgets. BanQ has three primary functionalities - 
- Enables users to log in their expenses with a SNU specific interface.
- Tracks the user’s expenditure according to their set budget in SNU.
- Allows the users to channelise their budgets.
- Allows seamless splitting of bills across users. 

The idea is to empower the students with the knowledge of their spendings and enable them to save as much money as possible. We also aim to streamline the consumer experience on campus.
